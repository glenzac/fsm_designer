# fsm_designer
This repository contains a C++ program that can be used to generate state tables and transition tables which can be used for FSM design. This repository uses [seleznevae's](https://github.com/seleznevae) cross-platform library - [libfort](https://github.com/seleznevae/libfort) to create well formatted tables.
